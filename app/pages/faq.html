          I’ve been Playing Civilisation  for 36 Hours - Where Can I Sleep?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We have a dedicated sleeping area, separate from the main LAN room and gaming bar. We recommend bringing an air mattress / camp bed, sleeping bag and pillow. While attendees are very considerate towards the beauty sleep of others we do recommend ear plugs in order to secure the best quality shut-eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that sleeping space is limited and attendees bringing double airbeds, futons or the hollowed out carcass of a Tauntaun may not have enough room.

          I Can’t Survive on LAN Alone - What Will I Eat?
        </h3>
        <p>
          HoGLAN sports a tuck-shop selling a variety of drinks and snacks. A 
          dizzying array of local takeaways will also deliver direct to the venue. 
          HoGLAN also runs scheduled food events including the ‘HoG Roast’. 
          Failing that, HoGLAN is situated smack bang in the centre of 
          Sheffield, with plenty of supermarkets, restaurants and bars within 
          walking (or staggering) distance. Eating fellow attendees is 
          discouraged.

          Entrance to the venue is through a single route that is clearly visible to 
          all attendees. The venue has CCTV throughout and the external doors 
          are locked at night. The organisers do their best to ensure someone is 
          always awake to keep an eye on the equipment.
