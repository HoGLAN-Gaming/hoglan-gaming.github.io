    </div>
    <h3>
      How do I get tickets?
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are currently no tickets available for HoGLAN. It is run on a contribution
      basis by and for the whole HoG community. We hope to leave private beta soon,
      at that time tickets will be on sale to the general public.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Private Beta?
    </h3>
    <p>
      HoGLAN has been running for 2 years, and started out as a top-up LAN 
      to keep the calendar full of gaming. Community enthusiasm was such 
      that it swiftly evolved in to a larger event, with attendance 
      increasing each subsequent party. Each one has thrown up its own 
      challenges for the organisers to overcome though, so the decision was 
      made to keep it an invite-only event until it is polished enough to 
      open up to the public.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I’ve been Playing Civilisation  for 36 Hours - Where Can I Sleep?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We have a dedicated sleeping area, separate from the main LAN room 
      and gaming bar. We recommend bringing an air mattress / camp bed, 
      sleeping bag and pillow – or fighting over one of the sofas! 
      While attendees are very considerate towards the beauty sleep of 
      others we do recommend ear plugs in order to secure the best quality 
      shut-eye.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I Can’t Survive on LAN Alone - What Will I Eat?
    </h3>
    <p>
      HoGLAN sports a tuck-shop selling a variety of drinks and snacks. 
      A dizzying array of local takeaways will also deliver to the venue. 
      HoGLAN also often runs scheduled food events including the 
      ‘HoG Hog Roast’. Failing that, HoGLAN is situated a stone’s throw 
      away from the centre of Sheffield, with plenty of supermarkets, 
      restaurants and bars within walking (or staggering) distance. 
      Eating fellow attendees is discouraged.
    </p>

    <h3>
      I Smell Of Win – Where Can I Wash?
    </h3>
    <p>
      While HoGLAN does include several bathrooms, it does not currently have
      shower facilities.  This is something the organisers are looking to 
      address when the event leaves beta.  However there is an 
      <a href='/activities'>organised trip</a> to a local leisure centre 
      for a swim and shower.
    </p>

    <h3>
      I’m Bored Of Video Games – What Else Is There To Do?
    </h3>
    <p>
    Lots!  Between the pub quizzes, movie nights, meals out, swimming, 
    board games, and nerf wars we sometimes forget to get any gaming done! 
    For more information please consult the 
    <a href='/activities'>activities</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I’ve Pimped My Rig – What About Security?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Entrance to the venue is behind two locked doors, accessible only 
      through key and passcode.  Entry is controlled by the organisers and 
      other key holders. Your equipment is left at your own risk, the 
      organisers can not be held responsible for any loss or damage.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Public Transport Smells of Wee – Is There Parking For My Marvellous Car?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes there is, however please let the organisers know ahead of time if
      you will be bringing one so they can ensure that enough spaces are reserved.
