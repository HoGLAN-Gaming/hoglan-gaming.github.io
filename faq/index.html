          I’ve been Playing Civilisation  for 36 Hours - Where Can I Sleep?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We have a dedicated sleeping area, separate from the main LAN room and gaming bar. 
          We recommend bringing an air mattress / camp bed, sleeping bag and pillow. 
          While attendees are considerate towards the beauty sleep of others we do 
          recommend ear plugs in order to secure the best quality shut-eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that sleeping space is limited and attendees bringing 
          double airbeds, futons or the hollowed out carcass of a Tauntaun may not have enough room.
        </p>

          I Can’t Survive on LAN Alone - What Will I Eat?
        </h3>
        <p>
          HoGLAN sports a tuck-shop selling a variety of drinks and snacks. A 
          dizzying array of local takeaways will also deliver direct to the venue. 
          HoGLAN also runs scheduled food events including the ‘HoG Roast’. 
          Failing that, HoGLAN is situated smack bang in the centre of 
          Sheffield, with plenty of supermarkets, restaurants and bars within 
          walking (or staggering) distance. Eating fellow attendees is 
          discouraged.
